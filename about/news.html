<h3>Federal Leaders Gather to Accelerate President’s Management Agenda Initiatives</h3>
<div style="width:300px;font-size:80%;text-align:center;float:left;padding-right:10px;"><p><img alt="Emily Murphy" src="../img/news-pma-event-1.png" width="300"><i>Federal leaders listen to GSA Administrator Emily Murphy’s opening remarks.</i></p></div>
<p>More than 200 federal C-suite leaders gathered in early April to better understand the <a href="http://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html">President’s Management Agenda (PMA)</a> and how they can individually and collectively move it forward. Event participants included leaders for six of the Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals that drive implementation of the PMA.</p>
<p>“The President’s Management Agenda sets out a roadmap for the way ahead. It’s an important step forward along this path because we don’t accomplish anything without leadership’s buy-in and engagement,” said Karen Dunn Kelley, who leads a CAP goal focused on “Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset.”</p>
<p>Kelley underscored the importance of the CAP goal leaders’ roles. “We come from very diverse organizations with different missions, but taken together it is us that the American people rely on to deliver the critical missions of the federal government, provide excellent customer service, and manage our precious tax dollars.”</p>

<h3>Federal Agencies Release First Quarterly Update on Agency Priority Goal Progress</h3>
<p>Federal agencies released today their implementation action plans and first progress updates on their fiscal year (FY) 2018-19 Agency Priority Goals (APG). The quarterly updates focus on the progress agencies made during the first quarter (Q1) of FY 2018, detailing their achievements while also identifying barriers and necessary changes to implementation strategies to achieve goal outcomes.
</p>
<p>Federal  agencies established the FY2018-19 APGs with the President's FY 2019 Budget. Agency leaders from major Federal agencies set APGs every two years, identify responsible officials for goal achievement, and review performance on a quarterly basis. APGs bring focus to mission areas where agencies need to drive significant progress and change. APGs are outcome-oriented, ambitious, and measurable with specific targets set that reflect a near-term result or achievement agency leadership wants to accomplish within approximately 24 months.</p>

  <h3>OMB Launches President’s Management Agenda and Kansas City Listening Tour</h3>
  <p><em>Kansas City, MO</em> – Today, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) kicked off a two-day listening tour to engage federal workers and citizens in discussions about improving government services. Hosting several events in the greater Kansas City area, which is home to nearly 50,000 federal employees,  the listening tour was led by OMB’s Deputy Director of Management <b>Margaret Weichert</b>, and federal leaders, Government Services Administration (GSA) Administrator <b>Emily Murphy</b>, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director <b>Dr. Jeff Pon</b> and Federal Chief Information Officer <b>Suzette Kent</b>.</p>

  <p>In addition to the tour, Ms. Weichert unveiled the <a href="../PMA/PMA.html">President’s Management Agenda (PMA)</a>, the Administration’s strategy and long-term vision for modernizing the federal government. Through holistic efforts, the PMA focuses on better supporting three key areas of mission, service, and stewardship of government resources. PMA implementation will drive change through modern information technology, data accountability and transparency, and a modern workforce.</p>
<p><em>“We know that the public is frustrated with government’s perceived inability to deliver quality services for the American people,” said Ms. Weichert. “Through the President’s Management Agenda, this Administration is showing its commitment to modernizing Government, eliminating antiquated processes. This listening tour reflects the Administration’s understanding that transformational change starts with listening to citizens and agencies and aligning government services to meet those 21st century needs.”</em></p>
<p>For the first time, the President’s Management Agenda was presented outside of Washington, D.C. Kansas City was chosen because it is home to a large federal workforce and is an important hub of future federal innovation.

        <h3>Agencies Establish Revised Strategic Plans and Agency Priority Goals with the President's FY 2019 Budget</h3>
        <p>Federal agencies today published updated Strategic Plans spanning 2018-2022, and established Agency Priority Goals (APGs) to be achieved over the course of 2018-2019. Set at the beginning of each new term of an Administration, the Agency Strategic Plan defines the agency’s mission, presents the long-term goals objectives an agency hopes to accomplish, strategies planned, and the approaches it will use to monitor its progress in addressing specific national problems, needs, challenges, and opportunities related to its mission.
        <p> A goal accountability structure of the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, agency leaders set approximately 4 to 5 APGs every two years. These goals reflect the top priorities of Agency leadership, are aligned with the Administration’s priorities, results-oriented, implementation-focused, and measurable.  Per the GPRA Modernization Act, Agency Chief Operating Officers or Deputy Secretaries regularly review progress towards achieving their APGs with quarterly performance updates posted to this site. </p>
        <!--<p> With publication of the FY 2019 Budget, the Administration also released the framework for the Trump Administration’s President’s Management Agenda, outlining key government-wide management reform priorities and initiatives the Administration will seek to tackle over the next four years. In March, the Administration will announce more specific efforts to advance progress on the President’s Management Agenda, including senior accountable officials, concrete goals, and trackable metrics to ensure public accountability.<p/> -->
