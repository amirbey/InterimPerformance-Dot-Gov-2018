<h1>CX CAP Goal Resources for Agencies</h1>
<p>In an effort to raise the 
            <h2>Customer Experience Maturity Self-Assessment and Action Plan</h2>
            <p>Each fiscal year, agencies and programs that provide services to customers should complete a self-assessment
across this initial customer experience maturity model and use the result of this to develop an action plan identifying focus areas for
increasing capacity and conducting specific CX activities.
            <h2>Customer Experience Metrics</h2>     
            <p>Agencies should identify their highest-impact customer journeys (using customer volume, annual program
cost, and/or knowledge of customer priority as weighting factors) and select touchpoints/transactions within
those journeys to collect feedback in order to continuously improve their services. Initially, Federal customer experience will be focused on real-time
transaction-level measures, but agencies are encouraged to also solicit annual customer feedback reflecting
on customersâ€™ overall series of interactions, completion of journeys, and relationship with the agency. At a minimum, Federal Government customer experience should be measured in seven domains:
<ul>
  <li>Overall: (1) Satisfaction, (2) Confidence/Trust</li>
  <li>Service: (3) Efftiveness/Quality</li>
  <li>Process: (4) Ease/Simplicity, (5) Efficiency/Speed, (6) Equity/Transparency</li>
  <li>People:  (7) Employee Helpfulness</li>
</ul>
These domains have been developed in alignment with leading practices from both the private and public sectors, including Fortune 500 companies, market research institutions, and international organizations. 

            <h2>High-Impact Service Providers</h2>            
<p>High-Impact Service Providers are those Federal entities designated by OMB that provide the most highimpact customer-facing services, either due to a large customer base or a high impact on those served by the program. A HISP is one that interacts with the public to provide a transactional service or perform a regulatory function in which time, money, or information is used to receive a good, service, or authorization. HISPs will be reviewed and updated periodically by OMB. HISPs are requird to submit data on the customer experience metrics listed above quarterly.<p>
